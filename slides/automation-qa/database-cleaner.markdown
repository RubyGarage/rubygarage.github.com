## Setup Database cleaning

### If you are using Rails later than 5.1.5

The main idea `Database cleaning` is to start each example with a clean database, create whatever data
is necessary for that example, and then remove that data by simply rolling back
the `transaction` at the end of the example.

--

Make sure that `use_transactional_fixtures = true` it will run every example within a transaction

spec/rails_helper.rb <!-- .element: class="filename" -->

```ruby
config.use_transactional_fixtures = true
```

Define `basic_configure` file, which manages the Capybara driver configuration:

spec/support/basic_configure.rb <!-- .element: class="filename" -->

```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.before(:each, type: :system) do
    driven_by :rack_test
  end
  config.before(:each, type: :system, js: true) do
    driven_by :selenium_chrome_headless
  end
end
```

`driven_by` - is Rails method which manages the Capybara driver configuration. The argument to driven_by is the Capybara driver.

`:type` - is rspec-rails method which define directory structure (system, feature, model, controller, [etc](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/v/3-9/docs/directory-structure).)

`:system` - is system specs are RSpec's wrapper around Rails' own [system tests](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs/system-specs/system-spec)

### Data created in before(`:each`) are **rolled back**

Any data you create in a before(`:each`) hook will be rolled back at the end of
the example. This is a good thing because it means that each example is
isolated from state that would otherwise be left around by the examples that
already ran. For example:

```ruby
describe Widget do
  before(:each) do
    @widget = Widget.create
  end
  it "does something" do
    expect(@widget).to do_something
  end
  it "does something else" do
    expect(@widget).to do_something_else
  end
end
```

The `@widget` is recreated in each of the two examples above, so each example
has a different object, and the underlying data is rolled back so the data
backing the `@widget` in each example is new.

`Note` Data created in before(`:all`) are **not rolled back**

## Setup Database cleaning

### If you are using Rails earlier than 5.1.5

Earlier versions of Rails 5.1 had a defect in ActionDispatch::SystemTesting::Server that caused problems with previous method of cleaning database.

--

The first thing we need to do is add our gem to Gemfile in `:test` group

```ruby
group :test do
  gem "database_cleaner"
  gem "selenium-webdriver" # from box only in Rails later than 5.1
end
```

Then, run `bundle` to download and instal new gem

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Change `use_transactional_fixtures = false` this will disable rspec-railsâ€™ implicit wrapping of tests in a
database transaction. 	

spec/rails_helper.rb <!-- .element: class="filename" -->

```ruby
config.use_transactional_fixtures = false
```

--

Define `database_cleaner` file, which manages the [Database cleaner](https://github.com/DatabaseCleaner/database_cleaner) configuration:

spec/support/database_cleaner.rb <!-- .element: class="filename" -->

```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.before(:suite) do
    DatabaseCleaner.clean_with(:truncation)
  end
  config.before(:each) do
    DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :transaction
  end
  config.before(:each, :js => true) do
    DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :truncation
  end
  config.before(:each) do
    DatabaseCleaner.start
  end
  config.after(:each) do
    DatabaseCleaner.clean
  end
end
```

# The end
