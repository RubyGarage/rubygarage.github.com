# Git

---

# What is Git?

> It is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.

---

# Why Git?

### Distributed
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### Exceptionally fast performance
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### Branching and merging
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### Team collaboration
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### Friendly big community

---

# What is Git Repository?

> The purpose of Git is to manage a project, or a set of files, as they change over time. Git stores this information in a data structure called a repository.

---

# What is Remote Repo?

> To communicate with the outside world, git uses what are called remotes. These are repositories other than the one on your local disk which you can push your changes into (so that other people can see them) or pull from (so that you can get others changes).

---

# What is Git Branch?

> A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to commits. The default branch name in Git is `master`. As you initially make commits, you’re given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, it moves forward automatically.

---

# What is Git staging area?

![](/assets/images/git/basics/staging-area.png)

---

# File status lifecycle

![](/assets/images/git/basics/file-status-lifecycle.png)

---

# What is commit?

> A "commit" is a snapshot of your files. Stores the current contents of the index in a new commit along with a log message from the user describing the changes.

---

# What is commit hash?

> Unique ID for particular commit. Big cryptographic string that is directly generated based on the information it represents. Because it is generated based on the information contained in the commit, the hash cannot be changed.

---

# What is `HEAD`?

> A head is simply a reference to a commit object. Each head has a name (branch name or tag name, etc). By default, there is a head in every repository called master. A repository can contain any number of heads. At any given time, one head is selected as the “current head”. This head is aliased to HEAD, always in capitals.

---

# Basic configuration

> Git comes with a tool called `git config` that lets you get and set configuration variables that control all aspects of how Git looks and operates.

> You can make Git read and write to `~/.gitconfig` file specifically by passing the --global option.

--

## Your Identity

> The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and it’s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:

```shell
$ git config --global user.name 'John Doe'
$ git config --global user.email 'johndoe@example.com'
```

# Commands in Details

---

# Initialization

Lets create our first repository

```shell
$ mkdir repo-example && cd repo-example

$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/john/repo-example/.git/
```

---

# Commit

```shell
$ echo "TEST" > README.md

$ git add README.md

$ git commit -m 'Add README.md'
[master (root-commit) 2b726fa] Add README.md
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md
```

--

When you `commit`, git creates a new commit object using the files from the stage and sets the parent to the current commit. It then points the current branch to this new commit.

Sometimes a mistake is made in a commit, but this is easy to correct with `git commit --amend`. When you use this command, git creates a new commit with the same parent as the current commit. (The old commit will be discarded if nothing else references it).

A merge creates a new commit that incorporates changes from other commits. Before merging, the stage must match the current commit. The trivial case is if the other commit is an ancestor of the current commit, in which case nothing is done. The next most simple is if the current commit is an ancestor of the other commit. This results in a fast-forward merge. The reference is simply moved, and then the new commit is checked out.

# Deleting a Branch

```shell
$ git branch -d feature/my-new-branch
Deleted branch feature/my-new-branch (was 0f005b6).

$ git branch
* master
```

The `-d` option is an alias for `--delete`, which only deletes the branch if it has already been fully merged in its upstream branch. You could also use `-D`, which is an alias for `--delete --force`, which deletes the branch "irrespective of its merged status."

---

# Reset

```shell
$ echo '<?= "I love PHP" ?>' > index.php

$ git add .

$ git status

  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   index.php

$ git reset

$ git status

  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	index.php

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

# Pull Requests

> Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.<br />
> Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.

---

# Creating the pull request

- On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

- In the "Branch" menu, choose the branch that contains your commits.<br/> ![](/assets/images/git/basics/pr-branch-dropdown.png)

- To the right of the Branch menu, click **New pull request**.<br/> ![](/assets/images/git/basics/pr-new.png)

---

# Creating the pull request

- Use the **base** branch dropdown menu to select the branch you'd like to merge your changes into, <br/>
then use the **compare** branch drop-down menu to choose the topic branch you made your changes in.<br/> ![](/assets/images/git/basics/pr-choose-branch.png)

- Type a title and description for your pull request.<br/> ![](/assets/images/git/basics/pr-title-description.png)

- Click **Create Pull Request**.

---

# Pull Requests best practices

- Don't build too [complex Pull Requests](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/)
- Don't create too complex commits. 300-600 lines of changed code is acceptable.
- Good commit messages and Pull Request titles
- Do not resolve the comments if no changes are done. Add a comment before clicking Resolve button ![](/assets/images/git/basics/pr-resolve-conversation.png)
- Check where do you merge. What's the base branch?
- Add tags to the pull request
- Use Pull Request templates

---

# Pull Request template

You can either add the PR template in the root directory itself or in a folder named `docs/` or `.github/`.
In order for Github to automatically pick up the formatting from the markdown file for PR templates, you must name the file `pull_request_template.md`.

```shell
JIRA ticket - [Replace this text by the JIRA tiket URL]

### Actions for Code run

F.E - copy database

### Rake Tasks

If PR contains Rake tasks/seeds describe them below

### Before submitting the merge request make sure the following are checked

- [ ] Followed the style guidelines of this project
- [ ] Performed a self-review of own code
- [ ] Wrote the tests that prove that fix is effective/that feature works
- [ ] The code linted with Rubocop/Fasterer/e.t.c
- [ ] API documentation is re-generated(if some endpoints changed)
```

---

# Commit message best practices

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain **what** and **why** vs. **how**

Example: `Fix typo in introduction to user guide`

# Conflicts

> Merge conflicts may occur if competing changes are made to the same line of a file or when a file is deleted that another person is attempting to edit.

--

## Explanation

- the top half is the branch you a merging into
- the bottom half is from the commit that you are trying to merge in

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
foo
=======
bar
>>>>>>> cb1abc6bd98cfc84317f8aa95a7662815417802d
```

> What this means in practice if you are doing something like `git pull` (which is equivalent to a `git fetch` followed by a `git merge`) is:

- the top half shows your local changes
- the bottom half shows the remote changes, which you are trying to merge in

# `.gitignore` file

> If you create a file in your repository named `.gitignore`, Git uses it to determine which files and directories to ignore, before you make a commit.

--

## Example of `.gitignore` file

```
# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore secrets
/config/application.yml
/config/database.yml
/config/cable.yml

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore spec files
/spec/examples.txt

.byebug_history

# Ignore encrypted secrets key file.
config/secrets.yml.key

# Ignore test coverage info
/coverage/*
