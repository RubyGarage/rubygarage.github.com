--

## What *IS NOT* GraphQL?

- Not a database technology

- Not a library to install

- Not a language or framework specific

--

## What *IS* GraphQL?

- A new API standard developed by Facebook that provides a more efficient, powerful and flexible alternative to REST

- A client specified query language for APIs - enables declarative data fetching where a client can specify exactly what data it needs

- A server spec - creates a uniform API across your entire application without being limited by a specific language, framework or database

---

# Advantages of GraphQL

---

## No more Over- and Underfetching

### One of the most common problems with REST is that of over- and underfetching. This happens because the only way for a client to download data is by hitting endpoints that return fixed data structures.

--

## Imagine...

### That we need to fetch user name and the first three of user tasks' titles for some kind of dashboard

--

## Using REST

```json
  # GET /user/:id
  {
    "user": {
      "id": "unqueUserId",
      "name": "Gogi",
      "email": "gogi@google.com",
      "address": {...},
      ...
    }
  }

  # GET /user/:id/tasks
  {
    "tasks": [{
      "id": "unqueUserId",
      "title": "Make sandwitch",
      "description": "...",
      "comments": {...},
      ...
    },
    ...]
  }

 ```

--

## Using GraphQL

```graphql
  query {
    user(id: 1) {
      id
      name
      tasks(first: 3) {
        title
      }
    }
  }
```

``` json
  {
    "data": {
      "user": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Gogi",
        "tasks": [
          { "title": "Make sandwitch" },
          { "title": "Eat sandwitch" },
          { "title": "Go to the toilet" }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
```

---

## Faster frontend development

### Thanks to the flexible nature of GraphQL, changes on the client-side can be made without any extra work on the server. Since clients can specify their exact data requirements, no backend engineer needs to make adjustments when the design and data needs on the frontend change. Also frontend engineers can stub schema and work before backend is ready.

---

## Less boilerplate work on the backend

`POST /graphql`

### Only ONE route is required for the GraphQL server

```ruby
  # app/controllers/graphql_controller.rb
  class GraphqlController < ApplicationController
    def execute
      ...
    end
  end
```

```ruby
  # config/routes.rb
  MyApp.routes.draw do
    post "/graphql", to: "graphql#execute"
  end
```

---

## Schema & Type System

### GraphQL uses a strong type system to define the capabilities of an API. All the types that are exposed in an API are written down in a schema using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL). This schema serves as the contract between the client and the server to define how a client can access the data.

--

### Example

```graphql
type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
}

type Mutation {
  addTask(title: String!, userId: ID!): Task
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  email: String
  birthday: String
  tasks: [Task]
}

type Task {
  id: ID!
  title: String
  description: String
  position: Integer
}
```

---

## Setup GraphQL server using Ruby on Rails

Add to Gemfile

```ruby
  gem 'graphql', '1.9.14'
```

Then run

```bash
  $ bundle
  $ rails generate graphql:install
```

--

### It generates base structure

```
- app
  - controllers
    | graphql_controller.rb
  - graphql
    + mutations
    + queries
    - types
      | base_object.rb
      | base_argument.rb
      | base_field.rb
      | base_enum.rb
      | base_input_object.rb
      | base_interface.rb
      | base_scalar.rb
      | base_union.rb
      | query_type.rb
      | mutation_type.rb
    | graphql_meetup_schema.rb
```

--

#### Graphql Schema
```ruby
  # app/graphql/graphql_meetup_schema.rb
  class GraphqlMeetupSchema < GraphQL::Schema
    mutation(Types::MutationType)
    query(Types::QueryType)
  end
```

#### Graphql base types
```ruby
  # app/graphql/types/guery_type.rb
  module Types
    class QueryType < Types::BaseObject
      # Add root-level fields here.
      # They will be entry points for queries on your schema.

      field :test_field, String, null: false, description: "An example field added by the generator"

      def test_field
        "Hello World!"
      end
    end
  end
```

```ruby
  # app/graphql/types/mutation_type.rb
  module Types
    class MutationType < Types::BaseObject
      field :test_field, String, null: false, description: "An example field added by the generator"

      def test_field
        "Hello World"
      end
    end
  end
```

--

#### Route
```ruby
  # config/routes.rb
  Rails.application.routes.draw do
    post '/graphql', to: 'graphql#execute'
  end
```

#### And controller
```ruby
  # app/controllers/graphql_controller.rb
  class GraphQLController < ApplicationController
    def execute
      variables, query, operation_name = params.values_at(:variables, :query, :operationName)

      context = { current_user: current_user }

      result = GraphqlMeetupSchema.execute(
        query,
        variables: ensure_hash(variables),
        context: context,
        operation_name: operation_name
      )

      render json: result
    end

    private

    # Handle form data, JSON body, or a blank value
    def ensure_hash(ambiguous_param)
      return {} unless ambiguous_param

      case ambiguous_param
      when String
        ambiguous_param.present? ? ensure_hash(JSON.parse(ambiguous_param)) : {}
      when Hash, ActionController::Parameters
        ambiguous_param
      else
        raise ArgumentError, "Unexpected parameter: #{ambiguous_param}"
      end
    end
  end

```

--

### GraphQL generator will offer you to install GraphiQL app and add `gem "graphiql-rails"` to Gemfile.
### GraphiQL is a nice IDE that helps you to test your GraphQL queries.

--

#### It is available under `/graphiql` path and looks like this:

![](/assets/images/graphql/graphiql-example.png)

#### Just write the query you want to test and press play button

--

### A better GraphiQL alternatives that allow you to configure HTTP headers:

- GraphQL Playground: https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-playground
- Insomnia: https://github.com/Kong/insomnia

GraphQL Playground demo: https://www.graphqlbin.com/v2/6RQ6TM

--

### Starting from version 7.2 Postman supports GraphQL
The only disadvantage of Postman is that you need to upload you GraphQL schema in order to have the autocomplete and that it doesn't have documentation sidebar

## Types, fields and arguments

---

### Types

#### Types describs data units in the system. There are such types as:

- Default scalar types
- Object types
- Custom scalar types
- Enum types
- Interface types

--

### Default scalar types

- Int: A signed 32‐bit integer.
- Float: A signed double-precision floating-point value.
- String: A UTF‐8 character sequence.
- Boolean: true or false.
- ID: The ID scalar type represents a unique identifier, often used to refetch an object or as the key for a cache. The ID type is serialized in the same way as a String; however, defining it as an ID signifies that it is not intended to be human‐readable.

--

#### Ruby example:
```ruby
  Types::Product = GraphQL::ObjectType.define do
    name "Product"

    global_id_field

    field :name, types.String
    field :price, types.Float
    field :rating, types.Integer
    field :recommended, types.Boolean
  end
```

#### Graphql schema example:
```graphql
  type Product {
    id: ID
    name: String
    price: Float
    rating: Integer
    recommended: Boolean
  }
```

--

### Object Types

#### The most basic components of a GraphQL schema are object types, which just represent a kind of object you can fetch from your service, and what fields it has.

#### Ruby example:
```ruby
  Types::Product = GraphQL::ObjectType.define do
    ...
  end
```

#### Graphql schema example:
```graphql
type Product {
  ...
}
```

--

### Custom scalar types

#### There is also a way to specify custom scalar types. For example, we could define a Time type:

```ruby
  TimeType = GraphQL::ScalarType.define do
    name "Time"
    description "Time since epoch in seconds"

    coerce_input ->(value, ctx) { Time.at(Float(value)) }
    coerce_result ->(value, ctx) { value.to_f }
  end

  Types::Product = GraphQL::ObjectType.define do
    ...
    field :createdAt, TimeType
  end
```

```graphql
  scalar Time

  type Product {
    ...
    createdAt: Time
  }
```

--

### Enum types

#### Enumeration types are a special kind of scalar that is restricted to a particular set of allowed values.

Example:

```ruby
  LanguageEnum = GraphQL::EnumType.define do
    name "Languages"
    description "Programming languages for Web projects"

    value "PYTHON", "A dynamic, function-oriented language"
    value "RUBY", "A very dynamic language aimed at programmer happiness"
    value "JAVASCRIPT", "Accidental lingua franca of the web"
  end

  Types::Product = GraphQL::ObjectType.define do
    ...
    field :language, LanguageEnum
  end
```

```graphql
  enum Languages {
    PYTHON
    RUBY
    JAVASCRIPT
  }

  type App {
    ...
    language: Languages
  }
```

--

### Interface types

#### Like many type systems, GraphQL supports interfaces. An Interface is an abstract type that includes a certain set of fields that a type must include to implement the interface.

```ruby
  DeviceInterface = GraphQL::InterfaceType.define do
    name "Device"
    description "Hardware devices for computing"

    field :ram, types.String
    field :processor, ProcessorType
    field :releaseYear, types.Int
  end

  Laptoptype = GraphQL::ObjectType.define do
    implements DeviceInterface

    ...
  end
```

```graphql
  interface Device {
    ram: String
    processor: Processor
    releaseYear: Int
  }

  type Laptop implements Device {
    id: ID
    ram: String
    processor: Processor
    releaseYear: Int
    ...
  }
```

---

## Type Modifiers

Object types, scalars, and enums are the only kinds of types you can define in GraphQL. But when you use the types in other parts of the schema, or in your query variable declarations, you can apply additional type modifiers that affect validation of those values.

--

### Non-Null modifier

```ruby
  Types::Product = GraphQL::ObjectType.define do
    ...
    field :title, !types.String
  end
```

```graphql
  type Product {
    title: String!
  }
```

Here, we're using a String type and marking it as Non-Null by adding an exclamation mark, ! after the type name in graphql or before the type object in Ruby. This means that our server always expects to return a non-null value for this field, and if it ends up getting a null value that will actually trigger a GraphQL execution error, letting the client know that something has gone wrong.

--

### List modifier

We can use a type modifier to mark a type as a List, which indicates that this field will return an array of that type.

```ruby
  Types::Task = GraphQL::ObjectType.define do
    ...
  end

  Types::TodoList = GraphQL::ObjectType.define do
    ...
    field :tasks, [Types::Task]
  end
```

```graphql
  type Task {
    ...
  }

  type TodoList {
    tasks: [Task]
  }
```

---

## Fields and arguments

--

### Fields

#### Fields are like functions - they receive arguments and have return type

#### `graphql-ruby` returns fields value from parent object by default.

```ruby
  Types::Product = GraphQL::ObjectType.define do
    name "Product"

    # this will return the price from products table
    field :price, types.Float
  end
```

--
### Resolvers

`grapqhl-ruby` allows you to assign custom resolvers to fields that allows you to customize field return value.
Resolver is expected to be an object that has a public method call (either proc object or class) that receives three arguments:

- obj - parent object, the object that query or mutation resolvers return
- args - arguments for this field
- ctx - context of the request that you send down in controller

and return value of the field type or nil if allowed

```ruby
  Types::Product = GraphQL::ObjectType.define do
    ...
    field :discountedPrice, types.Float do
      resolver -> (obj, args, ctx) do
        obj.price * 0.5
      end
    end
  end
```

--

### Arguments

#### Fields accepts arguments

#### The most common usecase is an `id`:

```graphql
  query {
    product(id: 1) {
      id
      title
      price(currency: "USD")
    }
  }
```

```ruby
  Types::ProductType = GraphQL::ObjectType.define do
    ...
    field :price, types.Float do
      resolver -> (obj, args, ctx) do
        SomeExchangeService.call(obj, args["currency"])
      end
    end
  end

  Types::QueryType = GraphQL::ObjectType.define do
    name 'Query'

    field :product, Types::ProductType do
      resolve -> (obj, args, ctx) { Product.find(args["id"]) }
    end
  end
```

You can get an access to field arguments in resolver using second argument (args).

---

## Queries and Mutations

---

### Schema definition

#### `graphql-ruby` generator creates schema file for us, so we don't need to create it

```ruby
  # app/graphql/app_schema.rb
  AppSchema = GraphQL::Schema.define do
    query Types::QueryType
    mutation Types::MutationType
  end
```

#### Schema must always include two root fields `query` and `mutation`. Those two includes other queries - for fetching data and mutations - for performing some changes in database

---

### Queries

#### `graphql-ruby` generator creates query type as well

#### Inside the `query type` you describe the fields which are actually could be fetched from server

```ruby
  # app/graphql/types/guery_type.rb
  Types::QueryType = GraphQL::ObjectType.define do
    name "Query"

    field :products, [Types::ProductType] do
      resolve -> (obj, args, ctx) { Product.all }
    end
  end
```

#### In our case we allow client to fetch all products

#### `Attention!` Query fields resolvers should always return the instance of object or an collection of objects the field type expects or nil if allowed.

--

#### Now let's query products form graphql server

```graphql
  query {
    products {
      id
      title
      price
    }
  }
```

```json
  {
    "data": {
      "products": [
        {
          "id:": "uniqueProductId",
          "title": "Sandwitch",
          "price": 1.0
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
  }
```

---

## Mutations

### Mutations are queries with side effects. Mutations are used to mutate your data. In order to use mutations you need to define a mutation root type that allows for defining fields that can mutate your data.

### Then add your mutations here:

```ruby
  # app/graphql/types/mutation_type.rb
  Types::MutationType = GraphQL::ObjectType.define do
    name "Mutation"

    field :addTask, Types::TaskType do
      description "Adds a task to list"

      argument :todoListId, !types.ID
      argument :title, !types.String

      resolve ->(obj, args, ctx) {
        todo_list = TodoList.find(args["todoListId"])
        todo_list.tasks.create!(title: args["title"])
      }
    end
  end
```

--

The mutation query would look like:

```graphql
mutation {
  addTask(todoListId: 1, title: "Title") {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

And response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "addTask": {
      "id": 10,
      "title": "Title"
    }
  }
}
```

--

### Complex resolvers with arguments

#### If you have complex mutations with lots of arguments and business logic its better to refactor them this way:

```ruby
  # app/graphql/resolvers/add_task.rb
  class Resolvers::AddTask < GraphQL::Function
    # arguments passed as "args"
    argument :todoListId, !types.ID
    argument :title, !types.String

    # return type from the mutation
    type Types::TaskType

    # the mutation method
    # _obj - is parent object, which in this case is nil
    # args - are the arguments passed
    # _ctx - is the GraphQL context (which would be discussed later)
    def call(_obj, args, _ctx)
      todo_list = TodoList.find(args["todoListId"])
      todo_list.tasks.create!(title: args["title"])
    end
  end
```

#### Then you can use it as field function in mutation query:

```ruby
  Types::MutationType = GraphQL::ObjectType.define do
    name 'Mutation'

    field :addTask, function: Resolvers::AddTask.new
  end
```

---

## Error Handling

--

### Schema validation errors

#### If you try to send an invalid request to the server, such as a request with a field that doesn’t exist, you’ll already get a pretty good error message back. For example:

```graphql
  query {
    tasks {
      unknown
    }
  }
```

```json
  {
    "errors": [
      {
        "message": "Field 'unknown' doesn't exist on type 'Task'",
        "locations": [
          {
            "line": 3,
            "column": 5
          }
        ],
        "fields": [
          "query",
          "tasks",
          "unknown"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
```

--

### Application errors

#### You can manually return instance of GraphQL::ExecutionError from resolver to respond with custom error. For example:

```ruby
  class Resolvers::AddTask < GraphQL::Function
    argument :todoListId, !types.ID
    argument :title, !types.String

    type Types::TaskType

    def call(_obj, args, _ctx)
      todo_list = TodoList.find(args["todoListId"])
      task = todo_list.tasks.build(title: args["title"])

      if task.save
        tasks
      else
        GraphQL::ExecutionError.new("Invalid input: #{e.record.errors.full_messages.join(', ')}")
      end
    end
  end
```

--

#### Let's perform the mutation:

```graphql
  mutation {
    addTask(title: "Short T") {
      id
      title
    }
  }
```

#### And what we get:

```json
  {
    "data": {
      "addTask": null
    },
    "errors": [
      {
        "message": "Invalid input: Title is too short (minimum 8 characters)",
        "locations": [
          {
            "line": 2,
            "column": 3
          }
        ],
        "fields": [
          "mutation",
          "addTask"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
```

--

### Form input errors

#### Previous example is good when you want to show errors as flash message, but it won't work if you need to show errors for each field in form. For this case you can create your own custom error. For example:

```graphql
  class Mutations::ValidationError < GraphQL::ExecutionError
    attr_reader :entity

    def initialize(entity)
      @entity = entity
    end

    def to_h
      entity.errors.to_hash.transform_keys { |key| key.to_s.camelize(:lower) }
    end
  end
```

#### And return it in resolver:

```ruby
  class Resolvers::AddTask < GraphQL::Function
    ...

    def call(_obj, args, _ctx)
      todo_list = TodoList.find(args["todoListId"])
      task = todo_list.tasks.build(title: args["title"])

      if task.save
        tasks
      else
        Mutations::ValidationError.new(task)
      end
    end
  end
```

--

#### Mutation:

```graphql
  mutation {
    addTask(title: "Short T") {
      id
      title
    }
  }
```

#### Response:

```json
  {
    "data": {
      "addTask": null
    },
    "errors": [
      { title: ["is too short (minimum 8 characters)"] }
    ]
  }
```

#### Now you have errors assosiated to the field name and you can easily show them on your form
