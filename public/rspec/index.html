  <h2>The value of tests</h2>
  <p>
    One of the most valuable benefits of tests is that they give you confidence that your code works as you expect it to work. Tests give you the confidence to do long-term development because with tests in place, you know that your foundation code is dependable. Tests give you the confidence to refactor your code to make it cleaner and more efficient.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tests also save you time because tests help prevent regressions from being introduced and released. Once a bug is found, you can write a test for it, you can fix the bug, and the bug can never make it to production again because the tests will catch it in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another advantage is that tests provide excellent implicit documentation because they show exactly how the code is designed to be used.
  </p>
</section><section id="writing-tests" class="slide">
  <h2>Writing tests</h2>
  <p>
    Let’s take a look at how tests are best structured. All tests should follow the same basic structure.
  </p>
  <div id="set-up-environment" class="slide">
    <h3>1. Set up environment for testing</h3>
    <p>
      Typically, methods perform some sort of operation upon data. So in order to test your methods, you’ll need to set up the data required by the method. This might be as simple as declaring a few variables, or as complex as creating a number of records in database.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your tests should always create their own test data to execute against. That way, you can be confident that your tests aren’t dependent upon the state of a particular environment and will be repeatable even if they are executed in a different environment from which they were written.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you find that many of your tests require very similar setup code, be sure to properly decompose the setup code so that you don’t repeat yourself.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="call-method" class="slide">
    <h3>2. Call the method being tested</h3>
    <p>
      Once you have set up the appropriate input data, you still need to execute your code. If you are testing a method, then you will call the method directly.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="verify-results" class="slide">
    <h3>3. Verify that the results are correct</h3>
    <p>
      Verifying that your code works as you expect it to work is the most important part of testing. Tests that do not verify the results of the code aren’t true tests. They are commonly referred to as smoke tests, which aren’t nearly as effective or informative as true tests.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="clean-up-environment" class="slide">
    <h3>4. Clean up environment</h3>
    <p>
      Environment always should be cleaned after a test running. That way, you can be confident that your next tests are not dependent upon the state of previous tests executing.
    </p>
  </div>
</section><section id="tdd" class="slide">
  <h2>TDD</h2>
  <p>Test Driven Development (TDD) is not about writing tests. TDD is more than that, it’s a methodology. The main idea of TDD is to write tests before code.</p>
  <div id="red" class="slide">
    <h3 class="red">‘Red’ – write failing test</h3>
    <p>
      This means that you have to have a failing test first. You can’t write any production code before ‘red’. Why? Because you have to know this test could fail in some circumstances and you have to know which change makes it pass.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="green" class="slide">
    <h3 class="green">‘Green’ – make the test pass</h3>
    <p>
      Write code that is only needed to make the test pass. Now, try to run the test again. WOW, passed! Do you think this is a bad solution? Doesn’t work fine? Sure it works fine, because the test passed. There is YAGNI principal (YAGNI stands for You Ain’t Gonna Need It) which says ‘don’t write more than you need at this moment’. If you are sure you need more, write test for it and then implement this functionality.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="refactor" class="slide">
    <h3>‘Refactor’ – clean up your code</h3>
    <p>
      Look at your code. Do you like it? Do you want to eat it? Do you want to f... it? If your answer to any of these questions was ‘no’, you should do something about that. Refactoring is changing code without changing its functionality.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="colorful-iteration" class="slide">
    <h3>The colorful iteration</h3>
    <p>
      Whole ‘red, green, refactor’ thing is about iteration, little programming cycles and fast feedback. When we write failing test we say ‘hey, my app should do that!’ Then we make it come true as fast as we can. It’s like in this game where you have to pass the ball to the next player before it ‘burns’ you. When you make a test pass, then you can relax and do refactoring. Change implementation, introduce design pattern and extract class or whatever you want. You have confidence that your code works all the time and that you didn’t break anything. This is the smallest programing cycle; this is exactly what TDD is about.

  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly, when should_not receives a matcher, it calls <i>matches?(self)</i>. If it returns false, the spec passes and execution continues. If it returns true, then the spec fails with the message returned by matcher.negative_failure_message.

  <h3>Predicate Matchers</h3>
  <p>A Ruby predicate method is a method that ends with a “?” and returns a boolean value, like <strong>string.empty?</strong> or <strong>regexp.match?</strong> methods. For these cases Rspec allows us to describe expectations with <strong>be_something</strong> matcher. When using a be_something matcher, RSpec removes the “be_”, appends a “?” and calls the resulting method in the receiver.</p>

    <li>"be_empty"   ->      "empty?"</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Alternately, for a predicate method that begins with "has" like Hash#has_key?, RSpec allows you to use an alternate form since "be_has_key" makes no sense.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>hash.should have_key(:foo)       ->    calls hash.has_key?(:foo)</li>

  <h2>Spec::Matchers</h2>
  <h3>Have</h3>
  <p>
    RSpec provides several matchers that make it easy to set expectations about the size of a collection. There are three basic forms:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>collection.should have(x).items</li>
    <li>collection.should haveatleast(x).items</li>
    <li>collection.should haveatmost(x).items</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These work on any collection-like object--the object just needs to respond to #size or #length (or both). When the matcher is called directly on a collection object, the #items call is pure syntactic sugar. You can use anything you want here. These are equivalent:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>collection.should have(x).items</li>
    <li>collection.should have(x).things</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can also use this matcher on a non-collection object that returns a collection from one of its methods. For example, Dir#entries returns an array, so you could set an expectation using the following:
  </p>
  <p>Dir.new("my/directory").should have(7).entries</p>
  <h4>A receiver IS a collection </h4>

  <h2>Spec::Matchers</h2>
  <h3>Custom matchers</h3>
  <p>
    When you find that none of the stock Expectation Matchers provide a natural feeling expectation, you can very easily write your own using RSpec’s matcher DSL or writing one from scratch.
  </p>
  <p>
    Imagine that you are writing a game in which players can be in various zones on a virtual board. To specify that bob should be in zone 4, you could say:
  </p>
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
    <![CDATA[bob.current_zone.should eql(Zone.new("4"))]]>
  </script>

  <p>But you might find it more expressive to say:</p>
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
    <![CDATA[bob.should be_in_zone("4")]]>
  </script>

  <p>You can create such a matcher like so:</p>
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
    <![CDATA[
    RSpec::Matchers.define :be_in_zone do |zone|
      match do |player|
        player.in_zone?(zone)
      end
    end]]>
  </script>

  <p>Also you can override the failure messages and the generated description:</p>
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
    <![CDATA[
      RSpec::Matchers.define :be_in_zone do |zone|
        match do |player|
          player.in_zone?(zone)
        end
        failure_message_for_should do |player|
          # generate and return the appropriate string.
        end
        failure_message_for_should_not do |player|
          # generate and return the appropriate string.
        end
        description do
          # generate and return the appropriate string.
        end
      end
    ]]>
  </script>
</section><section id="chaining" class="slide">
  <h2>Spec::Matchers</h2>
  <h3>Chaining custom matchers</h3>
  <p>You can also create matchers that obey a fluent interface using the chain method:</p>

  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
    <![CDATA[
      RSpec::Matchers.define :have_errors_on do |attribute|
        chain :with_message do |message|
          @message = message
        end
       
        match do |model|
          model.valid?
       
          @has_errors = model.errors.key?(attribute)
       
          if @message
            @has_errors && model.errors[attribute].include?(@message)
          else
            @has_errors
          end
        end
      end
    ]]>
  </script>

  <p>And now it can be used as follows:</p>
    <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
    <![CDATA[
      describe User do
        before { subject.email = "foobar" }
       
        it { should have_errors_on(:email).with_message("Email has an invalid format") }

  <p>When specifying interactions with a test double, the order of the calls is rarely important. In fact, the ideal situation is to specify only a single call. But sometimes, we need to specify that messages are sent in a specific order.</p>

</section><section id="responses" class="slide">
  <h2>Message expectations</h2>
  <h3>Setting responses</h3>

  <p>Whether you are setting a message expectation or a method stub, you can tell the object precisely how to respond. The most generic way is to pass a block to stub or should_receive:</p>

  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
    <![CDATA[
      double.should_receive(:msg) { value }
    ]]>
  </script>

  <p>When the double receives the msg message, it evaluates the block and returns the result.</p>

  <p>The same responses are available, as for stub method:</p>
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
    <![CDATA[
      double.should_receive(:msg).and_return(value)
      double.should_receive(:msg).exactly(3).times.and_return(value1, value2, value3)
        # returns value1 the first time, value2 the second, etc
      double.should_receive(:msg).and_raise(error)
        #error can be an instantiated object or a class
        #if it is a class, it must be instantiable with no args
      double.should_receive(:msg).and_throw(:msg)
      double.should_receive(:msg).and_yield(values,to,yield)
      double.should_receive(:msg).and_yield(values,to,yield).and_yield(some,other,values,this,time)
        # for methods that yield to a block multiple times

  <h2>So, let's create an application</h2>
  <h3>Introducing Codebreaker</h3>
  <p>
    Codebreaker is a logic game in which a code-breaker tries to break a secret code created by a code-maker. The code-maker, which will be played by the application we’re going to write, creates a secret code of four numbers between 1 and 6.
  </p>

  <p>
    The code-breaker then gets some number of chances to break the code. In each turn, the code-breaker makes a guess of four numbers. The code-maker then marks the guess with up to four + and - signs.
  </p>

  <p>
    A + indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code and in the same position.
  </p>

  <p>
    A - indicates a number match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code but in a different position.

  <h2>Selecting Stories</h2>

  <p>
    A great way to get started gathering user stories is to do a high-level brain dump of the sorts of things we might like to do. Here are some titles to get started:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Code-breaker starts game</strong>
      <p>The code-breaker opens a shell, types a command, and sees a welcome message and a prompt to enter
the first guess.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Code-breaker submits guess</strong>
      <p>The code-breaker enters a guess, and the system replies by marking the guess according to the marking algorithm.
      </p></li>
    <li><strong>Code-breaker wins game</strong>
      <p>
       The code-breaker enters a guess that matches the secret code exactly. The system responds by marking the guess with four + signs and a message congratulating the code-breaker on breaking the code in however many guesses it took.
      </p></li>
    <li><strong>Code-breaker loses game</strong>
      <p>
        After some number of turns, the game tells the code-breaker that the game is over (need to decide how many turns and whether to reveal the code).
      </p></li>
    <li><strong>Code-breaker plays again</strong>
      <p>
        After the game is won or lost, the system prompts the code-breaker to play again. If the code-breaker indicates yes, a new game begins. If the code-breaker indicates no, the system shuts down.
      </p></li>
    <li><strong>Code-breaker requests hint</strong>
      <p>
        At any time during a game, the code-breaker can request a hint, at which point the system reveals one of the numbers in the secret code.
      </p></li>
    <li><strong>Code-breaker saves score</strong>
      <p>
        After the game is won or lost, the code-breaker can opt to save information about the game: who (initials?), how many turns, and so on.
      </p></li>

  <p>We’ve told the double in the first example to expect puts( ) with “Welcome to Codebreaker!” and we’ve satisfied that requirement, but we’ve only
told it to expect “Welcome to Codebreaker!” It doesn’t know anything about “Enter guess:”</p>

  <h2>Refactor</h2>

  <p>"Refactoring is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code yet improves its internal structure."</p>

  <p>In this case, we have a very clear break between what is context and what is behavior, so let’s take advantage of that and move the context to a block that is executed before each of the examples.</p>
